Instructions For Setup
-------------------------

Simply click to run. Once it's running, left click to change a tile, and right
click and drag to move the camera around. You can also zoom in and out using
the mouse wheel.

It's possible to run lua scripts through the console. To activate the console,
press enter, then start typing lua code.

startup.lua opens and saves the main APIs into their default names. To select a
tile from the loaded tilesheet, type:

>	cursorAPI.SetTile(x)

Where "x" is the index of the tile you want to use. Index 0 means blank, index
1 means the tile at the top left, 2 is the next along the top, etc.

To load a new tile sheet from the scripts, type:

>	tileSheetAPI.Load(fname, w, h)

Where fname is the filename of the tileset you wish to load, and w & h are the
width and height of the tiles respectfully.

There are a number of other vestigial features that are active, but unused in
practice such as tile layers. These features may be used properly later.
